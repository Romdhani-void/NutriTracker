Got it—stripping it down to just calorie tracking, no fitness, no workouts. Here’s a very detailed, ready-to-run AI prompt for a minimal, cozy Calorie Tracker app using microservices:


Prompt (Calorie Tracker Only, Minimal & Cozy):
I want you to generate a full project idea and functional application concept for a minimal, cozy Calorie Tracker app.
Core idea: Users track their daily calorie intake and see if they meet their daily calorie goal. The app should be simple, visually clear, and feel cozy and calm, suitable for a GitHub portfolio.
User Flow:
User opens the app and clicks “Start Tracking.”
User enters:
Email address (used for one-time token access to edit their data)
Preferred display name (shown publicly)
The system sends a one-time token to the email. The user enters the token to unlock their edit dashboard.
User sets body details:
Weight
Height
Age
Gender
User sets daily calorie goal (for example, calories to maintain weight, lose fat, or gain weight).
Each day, the user logs foods with their calorie values.
The daily dashboard shows:
Total calories consumed that day
Whether the daily goal is met (green) or not met (red)
Users can view all previous days’ logs in chronological order.
Core Features:
Lightweight, passwordless authentication using email token
Body details input and daily calorie goal setting
Daily food logging with calorie tracking
Chronological view of all past daily logs
Visual feedback for goal achievement (green/red)
Cozy, minimalistic UI with soft colors, clean charts, or colored indicators
Microservices Architecture Suggestions:
UserService – manages user email, display name, and token-based authentication
GoalService – calculates daily calorie targets based on body details and user goal
DailyLogService – stores daily calorie entries and calculates goal status for the day
AnalyticsService (optional) – aggregates data for visualizations like weekly totals or averages
Suggested Tech Stack:
Frontend: Angular or React with TailwindCSS for cozy UI
Backend / Microservices: Node.js + Express or NestJS
Database: MongoDB (flexible schema for daily logs)
Visuals / Charts: Chart.js or Recharts for minimal progress charts
Email Token Service: NodeMailer or transactional email API
Data Models:
User:
email
displayName
token (expires after short time)
Goal:
userEmail
weight, height, age, gender
dailyCalorieTarget
DailyLog:
userEmail
date (YYYY-MM-DD)
caloriesConsumed
goalStatus (met/not met → determines green/red display)
Possible Future Enhancements:
Weekly or monthly calorie charts
Meal-level tracking (optional food names)
Export daily logs as CSV or PDF
Optional community sharing of meals (anonymized)
⚠️ Do NOT include fitness, workouts, DevOps, deployment, cloud, or monitoring.
The app should be minimal, cozy, and professional, showcasing microservices architecture, front-end/back-end integration, and clear visual feedback for daily calorie goals.
